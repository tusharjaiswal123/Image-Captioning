# REST API using Flask


### Dependencies

You need to have python installed in your systems. Make sure you have all the libraries installed on your system. <br>
To run it as local host you can clone the repository and run <strong>python app.py</strong> on command line(in the directory where files are located). <br>
To install all the required libraries run <strong>pip install -r requirements.txt</strong> on command line (in the directory where files are located). <br>
The system can also be deployed on the server.
I completed its backend using Flask but since it uses tensorflow in backend (large size) so it can not be deployed for free :( <br>
